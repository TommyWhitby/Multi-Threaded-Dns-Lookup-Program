Overview
The DNSResolver program is designed to resolve DNS queries using multithreading and synchronization techniques. It reads a list of hostnames from input files, performs DNS lookups for each hostname, and outputs the results to an output file. This program utilizes pthreads for concurrency and semaphores for synchronization.

Features
Multithreading: The program utilizes multiple threads to concurrently process DNS queries, improving efficiency by taking advantage of parallelism.
Synchronization: Semaphores are used to synchronize access to shared resources, such as the DNS cache and the queue of hostnames to be resolved, ensuring thread safety.
DNS Caching: Results of DNS lookups are cached to minimize redundant DNS queries, improving performance by reducing network overhead.
Input and Output Handling: The program reads hostnames from input files specified as command-line arguments and writes the results of DNS queries to an output file.

Compilation
To compile the program, run the following command:

gcc -o th-lookup th-lookup.c -lpthread

Execution
The program can be executed with the following command:

./th-lookup <inputFilePath1> <inputFilePath2> ... <outputFilePath>

Replace <inputFilePath1>, <inputFilePath2>, etc., with the paths to the input files containing hostnames to be resolved. <outputFilePath> should be replaced with the path to the output file where the results will be written.

Input File Format
Each input file should contain a list of hostnames, with one hostname per line.

Output
The program will output the results of DNS queries to the specified output file. Each line in the output file will contain the following information:

<count>, <hostname>, <IP>
Where:

<count>: The number of times the hostname appeared in the input files.
<hostname>: The hostname.
<IP>: The corresponding IP address obtained from DNS resolution.
